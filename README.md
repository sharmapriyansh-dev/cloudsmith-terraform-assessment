# Cloudsmith Terraform Assessment

This repository contains the complete documentation and evidence of my Cloudsmith Terraform assignment, demonstrating the automation of repository, team, and policy management using Terraform.

## Included in this repo are:

- Step-by-step markdown documentation for each task of the assessment  
- Screenshots capturing Terraform execution, plan, and apply outputs  
- Structured directories (`docs/`) for clarity and GitHub Pages publishing  
- Terraform source files showcasing automation of Cloudsmith configurations  

## Assessment Highlights

This project demonstrates practical infrastructure-as-code (IaC) usage with Terraform for Cloudsmith, including:

- **Repository Management**: Creation of QA, Staging, and Production repositories  
- **Teams & Permissions**: Defining Cloudsmith teams with fine-grained access levels  
- **Policies**: Setting up vulnerability scanning rules and retention policies  
- **Geo/IP Restrictions**: Applying rules for secure and region-based access  
- **Repository Settings**: Configuring metadata, upstreams, and defaults for usage consistency  
- **Service Accounts**: Automating creation of accounts for CI/CD pipelines  

## Documentation

Detailed step-by-step documentation can be found in the [`docs/`](./docs/) directory.  
All evidence (Terraform commands, outputs, and results) is included for review.  

The repository is also configured to publish via **GitHub Pages** for easy navigation and presentation.
